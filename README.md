# Static

![hello](https://github.com/noteed/static/workflows/hello/badge.svg)

This repository provides the `static/` directory used by `noteed.github.io/`
project pages, instead of each having its own copy.

Note: this repository was initially a copy of `noteed/actions`, a repository to
play with GitHub Actions.
