# Static

![deployment](https://github.com/noteed/static/workflows/deployment/badge.svg)

This repository provides the `static/` directory used by `noteed.github.io/`
project pages, instead of each having its own copy.

Note: this repository was initially a copy of
[`noteed/actions`](https://github.com/noteed/actions), a repository to
demonstrate a simple GitHub Actions workflow.
